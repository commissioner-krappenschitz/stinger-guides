# Considerations of Stingers Deployment

Prior to deploying spike strips officers must carefully consider the following:

* Is the location Iâ€™m deploying spike strips creating an **unsafe environment** for the general public or officers
* Is my vehicle and spike strip **positioned effectively**
* Am I in a **safe location** for this spike attempt
* Does the pursuit **know** I have a spike trap here
