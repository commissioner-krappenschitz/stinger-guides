# When to deploy Stingers?

Stingers can end up **killing** the occupants of a vehicle and so be considered lethal force. When stingers are used the vehicle can become uncontrollable letting the vehicle crash/ flip.

* After the officer himself sees reasoning enough for using the Stinger-intervention to eliminate the fleeing vehicle.
  * Note- this intervention timer does not need to be elapsed nor waived by a supervisor
* It is safe/ effective enough to be deployed
  * Note- it can only be called safe if Radio Traffic is clear, officers know they will be deployed and where and civilians can be protected
