# Safe Deployment

To safely and successfully deploy spike strips, an officer must:

* Smartly position themselves ahead of a pursuit
* Advise other units of their own position, and that spikes are being deployed
* Attempt to “funnel” the suspect vehicle into the strips with their patrol vehicle or the architecture of the road
* REMAIN IN ADEQUATE COVER as the target vehicle approaches, to ensure the officer is not struck by a vehicle or debris
* Remove the spike strips immediately after being hit by the target vehicle to ensure pursuing officers do not hit the strips as well
* Radio when spikes are removed
