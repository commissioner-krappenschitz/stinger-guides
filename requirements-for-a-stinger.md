# Requirements for a Stinger

Officers will not deploy spikes:

* On 2 wheeled vehicles unless lethal force is necessary to protect the public (bikers are considered more fragile)
* On any commercial passenger vehicle (a bus of any type), or commercial vehicle believed to be transporting fuel/hazmat
* In any area that would bring undue danger to innocent bystanders, (crowded area/ busy streets)
